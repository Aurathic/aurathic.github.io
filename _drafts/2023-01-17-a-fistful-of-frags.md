title:  "A Fistful of Frags"
---

Over the past few days, in lieu of actual work I've been procrastinating by playing [Fistful of Frags](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265630/Fistful_of_Frags/), a.k.a FoF -- a western-themed first person shooter which started as a Half-Life 2 mod from 2007. It certainly isn't the prettiest game, or the most polished, but it's still incredibly compelling and, because of some unique design decisions, unlike most other FPSes.    

# The Bad and the Ugly

The key difference between the gunplay in FoF and other shooters is that the guns are, to put it bluntly, shit. This isn't to say that they are poorly designed -- they are kinaesthetically very pleasing to use, with wonderful sound design and animations -- but since this is a Western FPS, the guns are all from the 1800s.

Let's compare the Remington Army revolver from FoF to the stock pistol from Team Fortress 2 (TF2), another first person shooter which I have played too much. When a player presses left click when holding the Pistol in TF2, the first shot is always perfectly accurate, meaning it goes exactly where the player is pointing, with a slight additional spread added to the subsequent shots [(Source)](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Pistol). [TODO find measure of the inaccuracy].

Let's compare to FoF. It's easy to see the accuracy of weapons in this game; a measure of "percent accuracy" is displayed right under the crosshair, where 100% means that the shot goes where your mouse is aiming and 0% means that it could go in any direction. When standing still with the Remington Army, the accuracy is 75 percent. But when you're walking normally, that goes down all the way to *one percent*. In other words, it's basically completely pointless to shoot this gun while you're walking. Furthermore, if you stop walking, the accuracy doesn't immediately go from 1% to 75%, instead increasing over the course of a second or so

This makes firing a great risk, because when you're not moving you obviously become a much easier target to hit. Moving and shooting become two separate modes you need to move between. As such, one on one battles become very weird looking dances, where each player pauses in turn to get a shot off then goes back to strafing.

The high inaccuracy also somewhat levels the playing field in terms of player accuracy, since even a perfectly accurate player will miss three quarters of their shots. This makes other skills like tactical positioning and knowing when to push more important in determining a winner. While walking across the map, you might spot another player go into a building, and instead of shooting straight at them (which is mostly a test of your twitch reflexes) you need to identify where they're going, then sneak up on them, then attack when they're stopped or otherwise occupied (i.e. when you can stand still and take aim without fear of being shot back).
Of course, there's always some frustration when you point your cursor straight at an enemy only for none of your shots to connect
